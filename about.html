<h2> Summary of Experience </h2>

<p> From a young age, I have been creating in art classes and in my free time. I have taken courses in figure-drawing, jewelry-making, color theory, and 3D design at Parsons and FIT and explored mixed media and photography at the Art Students League. In 8th grade, I started working with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.
<br>
In high school, I took courses in drawing with my Trinity teacher Gregg Emery and in a 9th grade photography class I learned to use a darkroom from Thomas Holton.
<br> I began oil-painting in 11th grade. I applied for and was accepted into the Aspiring Artists High School Program of the Arts Student League of New York. This program is a professional-level oil-painting class, taught by painter, Amy Weiskopf.
I am fascinated by career paths that enfold STEM and art, such as computer science (graphics), architecture, or product design. In my studies in college, I would like to further develop my technical skills in painting, photography, and drawing, to get exposure to art forms that I have not explored as much, and to continue to develop my individual style.

This program consisted of a professional-level oil-painting class every Sunday of my 11th grade, taught by contemporary still life painter, Amy Weiskopf. Under Amy's tutelage, I learned the fundamentals of oil painting (light, color, form, space, and composition), while developing my own style.
